\citeSK{alexander1964notes} 
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		(book, 224 pages) 
		The author presents a method for designing based mainly on mathematical set theory.
		Alexander argues that form (``the ultimate goal of design''), organization and physical order 
		is a result of {\em adaptive processes} according to some given human needs and requirements.
		Each form (or ``design'') has to be a good match for its corresponding context,
		and can be successful only if it comes into existence in small increments (i.e. step by step), 
		instead of all at once. Each of these increments represent design problems in themselves,
		transforming their own concepts into forms.

\citeSK{alexander1977pattern} 
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		(book, 1171 pages) 
	    This is the second book in Christopher Alexander's trilogy on architectural design 
	    (the first one was {\em The Timeless Way of Building} and the third one was 
	    {\em The Oregon Experiment}). It proposes a practical language consisting of 
	    approximately 250 patterns for building and planning based on 
	    intuitive, natural, historical and common-sense considerations.

\citeSK{alexander1979timeless}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		(book, 552 pages) 
	    This is the first book (552 pages) in Christopher Alexander's trilogy on architectural design 
	    (continued with {\em A Pattern Language} and {\em The Oregon Experiment}). 
	    In this book he provides the theoretical background 
	    for the matter exposed in the succeeding two books (see \cite{alexander1977pattern}
	    for {\em A Pattern Language}).

\citeSK{schon1983reflective}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		(book, 384 pages) 
	    This seminal and highly-influential book by Sch{\"o}n exposes a number of important ideas
	    in the field of design and/or design thinking.
	    The author starts by reviewing the current position of ``professions'' and their
	    apparent lack of prestige, as compared to ``researchers'', due to the prevailing
	    model of {\em technical rationality} based on hierarchical model of knowledge and
	    unwarranted emphasis on problem solving only, instead of devoting (at least the same
	    amount of) attention to {\em problem setting} (or {\em context framing}) as well.
	    In other words, technical rationality is unsuitable for design problems, which 
	    are ill-defined (i.e. not just ``given'') and require agile and contingent
	    definition of ends, means, and related decision-making processes.
	    
	    The author goes on to discuss the notions of {\em knowing-in-action} 
	    (knowledge can't always be expressed in words; professionals usually possess such tacit knowledge) 
	    and {\em reflecting-in-action} (constructing new knowledge in the context of
	    a given, concrete design problem). An action brings about a new understanding,
	    and in turn this understanding changes the design situation at hand as well.

\citeSK{ulrich1988function}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
	    This article describes the so-called \emph{function sharing} as a basis for computational design.
	    From a design consisting of a number of parts,
	    1) a part $P$ is removed,
	    2) parts which can fulfill the function of $P$ are found, and
	    3) the whole remaining design is then modified (tuned) to optimize the 
	    function of the parts found in step 2.
	    The authors argue that this procedure can lead to designs which 
	    are smaller, less expensive, more reliable, and perform better.

\citeSK{schï¿½n1992designing}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		This paper examines what would constitute an effective computer-based (AI) design program.
		Building on the fundamental premise that design is a ``reflective conversation with the materials of 
		a design situation'', and giving four different views on what an 
		``effective computational support for design''
		should offer (phenomenological equivalence, functional equivalence, assistance to 
		designers, and design research environment), the author provides a number of guidelines
		for building such design programs.

\citeSK{ward1995second}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		This paper examines Toyota's business practice of pursuing {\em sets} of design alternatives
		(named {\em set-based problem solving}), as distinguished from other Japanese and US car-makers
		which pursue the so-called {\em point-based problem solving} (Fig. \ref{fig:ward1995second}). 
		Based on this observation, 
		the authors claim that this set-based approach to design problem solving has made Toyota
		the most efficient carmaker in the world.

		design as a simultaneous search for both 1) problem definition and 2) problem solution.

\citeSK{simon1996sciences}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		In this highly influential and cited book, Simon espouses a number of important concepts.
		Simon suggests that {\em hierarchies} of systems and their subsystems are the 
		natural form of complexity,
		and that one of the most important characteristics of these hierarchies is the so-called 
		{\em near-decomposability}---the short-term functioning of subsystems is mostly 
		independent from each other, but long-term these subsystems do influence each other through 
		aggregation of influences (example: human body). The author also explores the nature
		of {\em artifacts}, which may be described in terms of their functions, goals and adaption.
		Artifacts can be described in several ways:\\
		- as a relation between the artifact, its environment and its purpose.\\
		- another, as consisting of its {\em inner environment} (internal structure of the artifact), 
		{\em outer environment} (the context in which the artifact is supposed to function), and 
		the {\em interface} between the inner and outer environment.\\
		The author touches on a number of other concepts later on in the book: system
		descriptions, state and process descriptions, the difference between natural and
		artificial worlds, applications in economics and social planning, and artificial intelligence examples.

\citeSK{sobek1999toyota}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		This paper, complementary to \cite{ward1995second}, claims that beyond the efficiency 
		of its manufacturing process, Toyota's second secret of success lies in its product
		development process (Fig. \ref{fig:sobek1999toyota}). 
		According to the authors, this process is somewhat paradoxical, 
		in the sense that although the process gives an impression of a slower one
		(due to delay of design decisions, and broader consideration of possible designs),
		it is overall actually faster and more efficient exactly due to these reasons, 
		when compared to design development
		processes of other companies.

		An empirical study showing that seniors, compared to freshmen, generate more alternative 
		design solutions. Seniors also perform wider background research on the problem (i.e. collect more data),
		generate higher-quality design solutions, and are more agile in shifting between design processes.
		\end{quote}

\citeSK{taylor2007software}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		The paper argues that design has been, and will remain, the focus of software engineering.
		Because the design ``lives'' at the interface of 
		a) our means for designing and 
		b) our aspirations for designs (see Fig. \ref{fig:taylor2007software}),
		as our means (programming languages, tools, components, \dots) get better with time,
		our aspirations (or wants, goals, \dots) rise too.
		Therefore design will always remain at the core of software engineering (or any other
		fields of human endeavour, for that matter).

\citeSK{stone2000development}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		The paper present {\em functional basis}, a design language for the domain of
		mechanical engineering whose purpose is to 
		describe designs in a functional manner, whereby a {\em function} is defined as 
		"an operation to be performed by a device or artifact" (or a part thereof).
		Functions are stated in the verb-object form, for example "import gas", "import human force",
		or "convert electricity to torque". Functions input and output quantities known
		as {\em flows}, which are classified into the following classes:\\
		- {\em material} (human, gas, liquid, solid), \\
		- {\em signal} (status, control), and \\
		- {\em energy} (human, acoustic, biological, chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, hydraulic,
			magnetic, mechanical, pneumatic, radioactive, thermal).\\
		The authors argue that this functional basis brings improvement in the following six areas:
		product architecture development,
		systematic function structure generation,
		archival and transmittal of design information,
		comparison of product functionality,
		creativity in concept generation, and
		product metrics, robustness, and benchmarks.

		Four cognitive behaviours typical for architectural designers:\\ 
			1) Rich representations\\
			2) Indiscriminate use of inventive strategies\\
			3) Non-standard problem composition schema\\
			4) Strategies of complexity management
% 			\begin{itemize}
% 			\item Rich representations
% 			\item Indiscriminate use of inventive strategies
% 			\item Non-standard problem composition schema
% 			\item Strategies of complexity management
% 			\end{itemize}
		
		Architects tend towards creative design strategies while engineers tend to routine design.
		
			\begin{itemize}
			
			\item {What do architects do that others do not under similar conditions?}
			Architects rely on analog representations; use a greater variety of representations;
			rely on a greater number of alternatives than other design professionals;
			BFS then DFS (experts); use pairwise integration strategy.
			
			\item {What cognitive activities remain constant across tasks and individuals?}
			Architects deal with a greater variety of tasks using a greater variety of
			methods than do other designers; rarely ever specialize --- even when they do,
			site and climate conditions demand diversity.
			
			\item {What justification is there to have a common core for different design disciplines?}
			Designers prefer situated learning; finding a shared set of problems that appeal
			to multiple disciplines; standards of problem decomposition and design staging.

\citeSK{cross2004expertise}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		Paper focuses on expert performance. 
		
		General view: expertise develops over time
		as a person matures, but that there comes a point when a peak of performance
		is reached, and then an inevitable decline begins.
		
% 		In the sciences, people seem to produce their best work in their thirties,
% 		whilst in the arts it may be in their forties. Some outstanding individuals
% 		seem to defy the general picture.
% 		Minimum period of practice and sustained involvement before performance
% 		reaches an international peer-level of achievement --- at least 10 years
% 		since the first involvement.
		
		Expertise is not simply a matter of possessing ``talent'', but is the result
		of a dedicated application to a chosen field.
		%		
		The development of expertise probably passes through different phases.
		%		
		Novices: DFS approach to problem solving. Experts: top-down and BFS. 
		
% 		{\bf Research problem}: there is still precious little understanding of the 
% 		differences between novice and expert performance in design, and how
% 		to help students move from one to the other.
% 		
% 		{\bf Research questions}:
% 		\begin{enumerate}
% 		
% 		\item What are the key differences between novice and expert behavior
% 		and cognition?
% 		
% 		\item How is the transition made from novice to expert?
% 		
% 		\item Can certain educational methods assist the transition more effectively
% 		or efficiently?
% 		
% 		\end{enumerate}
		
		Part of the development of expertise lies in the accumulation of experience.
		Something that distinguishes experts from novices that the experts have been
		exposed to a large number of examples of the problems and solutions that appear
		in their domain. But a key competency of an expert is the ability mentally to
		stand back from the specifics of the accumulated examples, and form more abstract
		conceptualisations pertinent to their domain of expertise. Experts are believed
		to be able to store and access information in larger cognitive `chunks' than
		novices can, and to recognise underlying principles, rather than focusing on
		the surface features of problems.
		
		One problem-solving strategy used by expert designers seems to be different
		from that employed by other kinds of problem solvers (i.e. non-expert problem solvers), 
		who usually attempt to
		{\em define or understand the problem fully before making solution attempts}.
		Many studies of expert design behaviour suggest that {\bf expert designers move rapidly
		to early solutions conjectures}, and use these conjectures as a way of {\em exploring
		and defining problem-and-solution together}.

		\begin{quote}
		\small
		The paper brings forth a number of interesting claims and statements with
		important implications for design education.
		Being good at analysis doesn't mean that one is good at synthesis.
		Furthermore, questioning is an integral part of design, and can be
		{\em deep questioning} (convergent questioning, truth values, facts --- operates
		in {\em knowledge domain}) as well as
		{\em generative design questioning} (divergent questioning, for which there are
		multiple alternative answers --- operates in {\em concept domain}).
		This is important in design education because concepts need not have truth values
		(as distinguished from knowledge). Furthermore, the paper goes into depth
		discussing project-based learning (PBL), and concludes that it improves student
		retention, increases student satisfaction, and ultimately learning.
		The authors also propose a number of methods to improve design education:
		1) paying attention to ethical issues,
		2) introducing mechanisms that monitor the quality of design education in-the-class,
		3) spreading engineering design courses over geographies, cultural boundaries, and
		national boundaries.

		A claim is given that design ability is intrinsic to all people, but
		it seems that some people are better at it than others; one suggested
		way to understand this ability is artificial intelligence.
		The concept of "creative leap" (sudden design insight) is described and looked into.
		Think-aloud study of one famous expert designer is given.
		A meta-study of a number of studies is given, contributing to our understanding
		of design cognition. Finally, the book explores the relationship between science,

		The paper presents an experimental study on how conceptual sketches influence
		the creation of thoughts and ideas that could not be seen before the very act
		of sketching ({\em emergence}), and how they influence reinterpretation 
		during early design activity. In the study, designers (N=60; half are novices
		and half are advanced) are asked to describe
		their sketches to other designers (verbal protocols; designers are video-recorded
		during their descriptions). The protocol were segmented into "segments",
		and experimental results show that advanced designers use more segments
		and more cognitive actions per minute, and have slightly longer description
		times.

		The idea of {\em design space exploration} rests on three premises: 
		1) it is a {\em compelling} model for designer action, 
		2) it is an {\em effective} basis for computer support, and 
		3) the computational support for it is {\em feasible}. 
		However, there is little work about the {\em design space} itself,
		and the paper develops a case for a particular design space representation
		based on {\em typed feature structures}. This formalism, when combined
		with $\pi$-resolution, offers

		\begin{quote}
		\small
		This book presents several richly-documented case studies (both think-aloud and protocol-study)
		in different areas of design (architecture, F1 car design, software, etc.).
		The author argues that design thinking is a highly complex process 
		for which there is evidence that there are high-level cognitive functions
		of our brain that control or process activities related to design.
		Also, designers work at different levels of detail; what sets expert designers apart
		from average designers is their ability to switch among
		these phases quickly and frequently. Designining well (i.e. at expert or master levels) 
		requires both theoretical and 
		reflective thinking, but also intense practice, education and training.

		If a rectangular space $R$ has been decomposed into $n$ rectangles $\{ r_1, \dots, r_n \}$,
		we say that we have a $T$-plan of order $n$. For example, Fig. \ref{dissectiontplan}
		(right) shows a $T$-plan of order $4$.
		
		Now let $h$, $v$, $s$ and $S$ be the following four partitioning operations: horizontal,
		vertical, left-spiral and right-spiral partitioning.
		$T*$-plans are those $T$-plans (i.e. rectangular dissections) which have been obtained by applying 
		exclusively these partitioning operations. (Therefore, $T* \subset T$.)

		representation (where each wall is written as an ordered pair of lists of the

		% SK: having just parametric modeling, although it's an advancement compared to conventional CAD,

		%
		% SK: also, parametric CAD presupposes that we ALWAYS have to work with 3D representations

		% SK: a thought: search engine which searches using different types of relations.
		%
		% SK: from the paper: "It turns out that the relationships that designers need to model

		%     SK idea: computing relations depends on the type of relations. For example,

		%
		% SK: idea: GC is too "heavy". An application must be quick, nimble, agile.
		%
		% SK: "In GC a node's independent variables can be either singletons or collections".
		%     What about references? For example, variable cs can be a reference to a coord. system.
		%

		%
		% SK: "The advantage of GC is that it helps me to think about what I am doing.
		%     The disadvantage is that it forces me to so think." --- Lars Hesselgren
		%     GC forces the user to think because the user has to specify relations whenever
		%     he creates/adds new element to the model.
		%     Instead, GC should adopt the approach from conventional CAD where the user just
		%     "puts" the component there, and the SYSTEM should help the user afterwards by either:
		%     1) not creating relations at all
		%     2) create default relations, using some AI module
		%     3) create "right" relations, well-adapted to the context, again using some AI
		% 
		% SK: Downside of GC is that the user has to manage FILES (e.g. .gtc files).
		%     The user should be relieved of this, and all changes/edits/modifications saved
		%     automatically, and presented nicely (through histories, etc.) so that the user

		This thesis distills (from prior work) 
		ten principles for building ``good'' design-supporting systems,

		the concepts of {\em claims analysis}, {\em factual matrix}, and 
		{\em consilience} of factual matrix. (An explanation is more consilient if
		it explains more classes of fact.) To validate the principles
		according to these novel evaluation methods, 
		three system prototypes that follow (partially or fully) the proposed principles were built.
		%
		The first prototype, XDS, implements all ten principles to a degree, and provides
		experimental support for them. Users of XDS generate more alternatives,
		and improve on existing designs. XDS introduces two novel UI features:
		halo menus (Fig. \ref{fig:jennings2010phdthesis}), and consequence displays.
		%
		The second prototype, Strange Eons, operates in a different space (game space),
		thus enhancing the consilience of the factual matrix. It implements just some
		of the design principles, allowing for more controlled evaluation.
		%
		The third prototype, Treesta, shows that design principles have a degree of independence.

		This paper gives a survey of state of art in parametric operations and geometric

		- {\em parametric operations} denote operations such as {\em extrude}, which satisfy
		  some implied constraints, and\\
		- {\em geometric constraint solving} denotes operations which satisfy constraints
		  explicitly defined by the user, such as {\em repositioning}.\\
		The authors claims that the downsides of parametric operations include the need
		for the user to think ahead about how to manipulate the geometric features of objects,
		as well as to manage possible cycles in the underlying parametric graph. This
		is to be contrasted with geometric constraint solving, whereby objects (containing parameters)
		are being put into the scene first, and then these parameters are being linked
		through constraint links. This gap presents opportunities for new advancements.
		
		Within the paper, the concepts discussed include: 
		solver competence, constraint graphs, constraint graph structure analysis,
		approaches to geometric constraint solving 
		(graph based [constructive, DoF, propagation], logic-based, algebraic, symbolic, 
		theorem-prover based, numerical-methods based), deformations, dynamic geometry,
		evolutionary methods, three types of graph-constructive solvers (top-down, bottom-up,
		hybrid), graph decomposition, under- and over-constrained problems, variable-radius circles,

		The authors examine, from the standpoint of cognitive science, 
		the relations between {\em parts}, and the {\em wholes} which they make up ---
		the so-called {\em meronymic} relations. Meronymic relations are:\\
		- transitive (if $a$ is part of $b$, and $b$ is part of $c$, then $a$ is part of $c$),\\
		- irreflective ($a$ is not part of $a$), and\\
		- antisymmetric (if $a$ is part of $b$ then $b$ is not part of $a$).\\
		As such, meronymic relations express strict partial ordering, and 
		structure the semantic space (i.e. the space of all concepts) into a hierarchy.
		The question is, however, whether there are several (many?) different classes of
		relations expressing "parthood", or just one? To answer this question, the authors
		came up with the following taxonomy of of meroymic semantic relations,
		as expressed in everyday English:\\
		- component-integral (pedal-bike),\\
		- member-collection (ship-fleet),\\
		- portion-mass (slice-pie),\\

		This paper discusses two well-known topo-visual formalisms (Venn diagrams, and
		graphs), and how to combine the two into a novel formalism, called {\em higraphs}.
		
		Venn diagrams have the capability to model {\em collections} of sets and 
		the following {\em structural} (i.e. set-theoretical) relationships between these sets:\\
		- {\em enclosure} (being-a-subset-of),\\
		- {\em exclusion} (being-disjoint-from), and\\
		- {\em intersection} (having-a-non-empty-intersection-with).
		
		On the other hand, mathematical graphs have the capability to model {\em connectedness}
		between vertices in a {\em single} set of elements $S$, with edges representing some
		(arbitrary) binary relation on elements in $S$. Thus, the information contained in
		graphs is {\em non-metric}: concepts like distance, shape and size have no meaning
		in graphs.
		
		Thus, graphs deal with a single set $S$; Venn diagrams deal with a 
		collection of sets $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$.
		%
		Graphs model relation(s) between elements of $S$ (using edges); Venn diagrams model set-theoretical 
		relationships ($\subset$, $\setminus$, $\cap$) between $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$.
		
		However, the author argues that in modern applications both capabilities are needed:
		large number of sets having set-theoretical relationships, {\em and} 
		some type of relation(s) (i.e. connectedness) among these sets. Furthermore,
		to prevent combinatorial explosion of Cartesian products, we often desire
		a representation capable of capturing the notion of Cartesian products in
		a compact way. The author thus presents a case for {\em higraphs}, which are
		built up in the following fashion: take Venn diagrams, augment them with the notion
		of "nesting curves", extend them to present Cartesian product, and 
		then connect them using edges or hyperedges.

		suggests applying a discrete transformation (using a version of shape grammars) of the model

		This paper presents an approach to shape grammar-based

		the generated buildings are automatically structurally sound, i.e. the buildings built according
		to these models would be able to carry their own weight.
		In other words, the authors
		present a method for generating masonry building geometry, based on physical constraints. 
		%
		Moreover, while in conventional 
		ways of designing a masonry building the analysis of structural validity is carried out 
		{\em post hoc} (i.e. after the building has been designed), the method suggested
		by authors in this paper automatically adjusts a set of free parameters {\em during the process}
		in order to obtain structurally sound masonry buildings. 
		%
		Thus there is no need
		to carry out a conventional structural analysis (which more often than not is relatively
		tedious) after the design has been completed. This way, even user with no experience
		in statics can design structurally sound masonry buildings.

		Three perspectives on creativity:
		\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item \emph{Inspirationalist} --- emphasis on brain-storming, free association,
		lateral thinking and divergence. 
		% Corresponding software is based on free association 
		% using textual or graphical elements, visual techniques for depicting relationships,
		% loosely connected concept nodes to avoid a linear or hierarchical
		% structure, mind mapping. Paper and pencil, sketches.
		
		\item \emph{Structuralist} --- emphasis on more orderly approaches, like studying
		previous work and using methodical techniques to
		exhaustively explore possible solutions, then evaluate these solutions
		and refine them. 
		% Software: libraries, web sites,
		% "what-if" tools (spreadsheets, simulations, models, animations), flow
		% charts, decision trees, structured diagrams, step-by-step exploration, experimentation, backtracking.
		
		\item \emph{Situationalist} --- emphasis on social and intellectual context. 
		% Peer
		% reviews, curators, competitions, prize juries. Three
		% components: domain (e.g. mathematics), field (gatekeepers, curators),
		% and person.
		
		\end{enumerate}
		
		
		Three levels of creativity:
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Great breakthroughs and paradigm-shifting
		innovations. E.g. Einstein's relativity theory, Watson
		and Crick's DNA discovery, Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring"
		
		\item Evolutionary creativity (the focus of this
		article) - useful evolutionary contributions that refine
		and apply existing paradigms. Normal science, doctors' diagnoses,
		lawyers' briefs, photo editors' stories.
		
		\item Impromptu/personal creativity. Lively
		conversation, attentive parenting.
		
		\end{enumerate}
		
		Four-phase genex framework (with eight primary activities):
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item \emph{Collect}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Searching and browsing digital libraries
			\item Visualizing data and processes
			\end{itemize}
		       
		\item \emph{Relate}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Consulting with peers and mentors
			\end{itemize}
		       
		\item \emph{Create}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Thinking by free associations
			\item Exploring solutions - what-if tools
			\item Composing artifacts and performances
			\item Reviewing and replaying session histories
			\end{itemize}

			\begin{itemize}
			\item Disseminating results
			\end{itemize}

		Based on the analysis of existing models of creativity, the authors suggest

		\begin{quote}
		\small
		The paper argues that what was Galileo's telescope, Thomas Jefferson's pantograph, 
		and similar devices in the past,
		software tools have become today---they will support creativity and thus enable new discoveries.
		Three key components of creativity: {\em domain} (e.g. mathematics),
		{\em field} (gatekeepers), and {\em individual}, so creativity is after all a social process
		(because it's the gatekeepers who deem a work to be "creative").
		The goals of the workshop were:
		1) to call for greater convergence of disciplines that are in any way related to creativity,
		2) to promote new research methods, and
		3) increase the ambitiousness and scope of creativity-related research programs.
		The authors propose a set of principles to be used in building tools that support creativity: 
		1) support exploration,
		2) low threshold (easy entry for novices), high ceiling (for experts), and wide walls (wide range
		of possible explorations), 
		3) support many paths and many styles, 
		4) support collaboration, 
		5) support open exchange, 
		6) make it as simple as possible---and maybe even simpler,
		7) choose black boxes carefully,
		8) invent things that you want to use yourself,
		9) balance user suggestions with observation and participatory process,
		10) iterate, iterate---then iterate again,
		11) design for designers,
		12) evaluate your tools.
		The report also suggest directions for further research: 
		1) evolve existing and develop new theories of creativity,
		2) identify the fundamental role of creativity in all disciplines,
		3) propose new tools that facilitate and enhance creativity,
		4) design socio-technological environments for creativity,
		5) formulate systematic foundations for distribution of creativity tools,
		6) develop new assessment methods, and
		7) emphasize education and learning.

\citeSK{ritchey2006problem}
		\begin{quote}
		\small
		The paper describes General Morphological Analysis (GMA), a problem-structuring method
		which avoids committing itself to quantitative cause-and-effect constraints, 
		i.e. is capable to express non-quantifiable constraints prevalent in ill-defined problems.
		In other words, GMA is not based on building graphs of causal relations and/or
		hierarchical structures, but on parameter dimensions constrained by logical relations 
		(see Fig. \ref{fig:ritchey2006problem} for an example).
		By indicating pair-wise inconsistency between dimensions, the method effectively
		eliminates entire (sub)sets of unfeasible configurations, 
		thus greatly simplifying the initial problem.

		parameters) is highlighted. By indicating inconsistent relationships, N can be significantly
		reduced, thus simplifying the initial problem.}

		\small
		There is a recent shift underway, from productivity support tools, to creativity support tools.
		These tools cannot be evaluated using conventional measures like time per task,
		cost per transaction, and similar, thus new evaluation methods are needed.
		Next, the author suggests a way forward in research related to creativity support tools, 
		by first focusing on developing tools
		that support 
		1) discovery in the sciences, 
		2) exploration in design, 
		3) innovation in engineering, and 
		4) imagination in the arts.
		To define creative processes, the author then goes on to first list three intersecting
		schools on creativity (structuralists, inspirationalists, and situationalists),
		then three Csikszentmihalyi's definitions (domain, field, individual),
		and three important mindset changes needed (developers, product managers, and researchers).
		The author proposes the following design principles for creativity support tools:
		1) support exploratory search,
		2) enable collaboration,
		3) provide rich history-keeping, and
		4) design with low thresholds, high ceilings, and wide walls.
		The author then suggest an assortment of techniques which could be applied in
		evaluting creativity support tools.

		The two most important concepts presented are:\\

		what changed in an affected part of the image, and\\
		- using these series as a way to implement redo and undo.

		a wall-sized tangible interface for collaborative design. % (Fig. \ref{fig:klemmer2002web}).
		The authors present a way to interact with histories, without forcing the user
		to cope with a cognitively-demanding complete derivation tree, through the use of 
		the so-called {\em stub-branching history presentation} (Fig. \ref{fig:klemmer2002web2}).
		In the simple qualitative evaluation study, the participants (professional web designers)

		The authors present the design and implementation of graphical history tools based
		on Tableau, a contemporary multi-dimensional database visualization system.
		They first give a short survey on how to store and structure history data (states,
		actions, or both), how to visualize history data (linear, branching, \dots),
		and how to interact with history (navigation, editing, search, and export).
		They then go on their approach in Tableau:\\
		- they adopted a hybrid state/action history model,\\
		- states are recorded as VizQL statements,\\
		- each action is classified into one of the following five categories:
		  shelf (add, remove, replace), data (bin, derive field), analysis (filter, sort),
		  worksheet (add, delete, duplicate), and formatting (resize, style) commands.\\
		- all basic history items can be grouped into composites,\\
		- when user visits a past state and performs an action, a new analysis branch is
		  added to the model,\\
		- support for merged histories.\\
		The history model in Tableau is visualized using a sequential, comic-strip display.
		Additional features include analyzing individual usage (based on behaviour graphs),
		and aggregate usage. Findings based on usage data:\\
		- undo was 12 times more common than redo,\\
		- formatting accounts for 24\% of all actions.

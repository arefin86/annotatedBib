However, how people perceive and interact with a visualization tool can strongly influence their understanding of the data as well as the system's usefulness. Human factors therefore contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools. Several research initiatives have begun to explore human factors in visualization, particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to be explored. Therefore, we aim to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.},

However, the principles were too generic and high-level to be useful as design or evaluation guidelines. The authors, all with more than 10 or 30 years of experience with various CAD systems, selected and reviewed 10 state-of-the-art 3D parametric design and engineering applications and captured what they thought were best practices, as screenshots and videos. The collected best practices were reviewed through a series of discussion sessions. During the discussion sessions, UI design principles underlying the collected best practices were characterized in the line of existing UI principles. Based on the best practices and the derived common UI principles, a new set of refined and detailed UI principles were proposed for improving and evaluating 3D parametric engineering design tools in the future.},

Human–computer interaction, like any vocational discipline, sits upon three broad foundations: theoretical principles, professional practice and a community of people. As an interdisciplinary field the theoretical roots of HCI encompass a number of other disciplines including psychology, computing, ergonomics, and social sciences; however, it also has theoretical and practical challenges of its own. The evolving internal and external context of HCI, computers, have become smaller and less costly; this has led to changes in nature of the users and uses of computers, with corresponding impact on society. The paper explores the current challenges of computers from the cloud to digital fabrication and the need to design for solitude. It suggests that HCI should not just react to the changes around it, but also shape those changes.},

A critical question is, how will humans interact with and steer these complex models? Initially, users applied direct manipulation to such models the same way they applied it to simpler visualizations in the premodel era–using control panels to directly manipulate model parameters. However, opportunities are arising for direct manipulation of the model outputs, where the users' thought processes take place, rather than the inputs. This article presents this new agenda for direct manipulation for visual analytics.},

	abstract = {In visual analytics, sensemaking is facilitated through interactive visual exploration of data. Throughout this dynamic process, users combine their domain knowledge with the dataset to create insight. Therefore, visual analytic tools exist that aid sensemaking by providing various interaction techniques that focus on allowing users to change the visual representation through adjusting parameters of the underlying statistical model. However, we postulate that the process of sensemaking is not focused on a series of parameter adjustments, but instead, a series of perceived connections and patterns within the data. Thus, how can models for visual analytic tools be designed, so that users can express their reasoning on observations (the data), instead of directly on the model or tunable parameters? Observation level (and thus “observation”) in this paper refers to the data points within a visualization. In this paper, we explore two possible observation-level interactions, namely exploratory and expressive, within the context of three statistical methods, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). We discuss the importance of these two types of observation level interactions, in terms of how they occur within the sensemaking process. Further, we present use cases for GTM, MDS, and PPCA, illustrating how observation level interaction can be incorporated into visual analytic tools.},

This paper reports the results of collaborative synthesis experiments conducted with expert geographers and disease biologists. Ten participants were worked in pairs to complete a simulated real-world synthesis task using artifacts printed on cards on a large, paper-covered workspace. Experiment results indicate that groups use a number of different approaches to collaborative synthesis, and that they employ a variety of organizational metaphors to structure their information. It is further evident that establishing common ground and role assignment are critical aspects of collaborative synthesis. We conclude with a set of general design guidelines for collaborative synthesis support tools.},

	abstract = {Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients--primarily protein and carbohydrate--in and around an exercise session. Some have claimed that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition. It has even been postulated that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients. The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing. Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only initiates the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance. Several researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize training-related muscular adaptations. However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise ‘window’ can vary according to a number of factors. Not only is nutrient timing research open to question in terms of applicability, but recent evidence has directly challenged the classical view of the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake with respect to anabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this paper will be twofold: 1) to review the existing literature on the effects of nutrient timing with respect to post-exercise muscular adaptations, and; 2) to draw relevant conclusions that allow practical, evidence-based nutritional recommendations to be made for maximizing the anabolic response to exercise.},

Subjects completed menu selection tasks while in a driving simulator. Menu text was set either in a ‘humanist’ or ‘square grotesque’ typeface. Among men, use of the humanist typeface resulted in a 10.6\% reduction in total glance time as compared to the square grotesque typeface. Total response time and number of glances showed similar reductions. The impact of typeface was either more modest or not apparent for women. Error rates for both males and females were 3.1\% lower for the humanist typeface. This research suggests that optimised typefaces may mitigate some interface demands. Future work will need to assess whether other typeface characteristics can be optimised to further reduce demand, improve legibility, increase usability and help meet new governmental distraction guidelines.Practitioner Summary: Text-rich in-vehicle interfaces are increasingly common, but the effects of typeface on task performance remain sparsely studied. We show that among male drivers, menu selection tasks are completed with 10.6\% less visual glance time when text is displayed in a ‘humanist’ typeface, as compared to a ‘square grotesque’.},

The design process has to be adapted in order to address human factors and road safety challenges. It is now widely accepted that user involvement in the HMI design process is valuable. However, the current form of user involvement in industry remains at the stages of concept assessment and usability tests. Moreover, the literature in other fields (e.g. information systems) promotes a broader user involvement with participatory design (i.e. the user is fully involved in the development process). This article reviews the established benefits of participatory design and reveals perspectives for automotive HMI quality improvement in a cognitive ergonomic framework.Practitioner Summary: Automotive HMI quality determines, in part, drivers’ ability to perform primary driving tasks while using in-vehicle devices. User involvement in the design process is a key point to contribute to HMI quality.

Auditory-vocal tasks were associated with shorter task times, fewer off-road glances, lower workload ratings, and reduced impact on vehicle performance. Primarily nominal differences were found between devices. Older participants had more difficulty performing tasks across both modalities, and difficulties were amplified for visual-manual tasks. A pattern of performance advantages were found when participants used the same operating system as the one they personally owned, including faster task completion, fewer off-road glances, and lower reported workload coupled with lower impact on lane variability. One's familiarity with a smartphone may, to some extent, impact the apparent level of demand associated with its use while driving. These findings highlight a need for a more comprehensive understanding of how technology training can aid in minimizing interface demands.},

	abstract = {To ensure safety and usability of automotive user interfaces, prospective validations during early prototyping stages are important, especially when developing innovative human-cockpit interactions (HCI). Real car driving studies are difficult to control, manipulate, replicate, and standardize. Additionally, compared to other study designs, they are also time consuming and expensive. One economizing approach is the implementation of immersive driving environments in simulator studies to provide users a more realistic awareness of the situation. Using simulator test environments puts the question of driving simulator validity forward, meaning the extent to which results generated in simulated environments can be transferred to real world environments. Thus, in this chapter the ‘Immersive model-based HCI validation method’, which was developed by the authors, will be introduced. First, the state of the art of driving simulators will be analyzed. For this, the authors defined the degree of fidelity based on the used elements. Next, findings of a series of driving simulator tests will be presented, which investigate the influence of immersive parameters in driving environments. Visual and auditory immersive parameters were used to analyze the validity of driving simulator environments, as well as different technologies (HMD, holobench, PC). Different levels of immersion (from low to high fidelity) were tested to examine this methodology. Thus, main intention was to demonstrate the generalizability and transferability of the ‘Immersive model-based HCI validation method’ for different use cases. Objective and subjective data show advantages regarding the situational awareness and perception for highly immersive driving environments while interacting with a navigation system.},

Background: In the past decade, a number of on-road, epidemiological, and simulator-based studies reported the negative impact of talking on a cell phone on driving behavior. However, the impact of text messaging on simulated driving performance is still not fully understood. Method: Forty participants engaged in both a single task (driving) and a dual task (driving and text messaging) in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Results: Analysis of driving performance revealed that participants in the dual-task condition responded more slowly to the onset of braking lights and showed impairments in forward and lateral control compared with a driving-only condition. Moreover, text-messaging drivers were involved in more crashes than drivers not engaged in text messaging. Conclusion: Text messaging while driving has a negative impact on simulated driving performance. This negative impact appears to exceed the impact of conversing on a cell phone while driving. Application: The results increase our understanding of driver distraction and have potential implications for public safety and device development.},

	abstract = {Even though they are a known source of distraction, touchscreens have become increasingly commonplace in in-vehicle infotainment systems (IVIS). We explore a novel approach to possibly make the use of in-vehicle touchscreens safer, by displaying the road ahead directly above a touchscreen-based IVIS. This may allow the driver to keep the road in his field of vision through the head-down display (HDD) during IVIS interaction. A within-group study was conducted with 24 participants in a simulated automotive environment, comparing a configuration with and without livestream HDD. Reaction rates and times to obstacles were measured and subjective ratings recorded with the NASA TLX and a qualitative questionnaire. While qualitative measurements indicate that the concept may hold the potential to improve the driver's interaction with an IVIS, differences in quantitative metrics were not statistically significant. We reflect possible reasons for this based on an analysis of participants' behaviour and our qualitative results.},

	abstract = {Distraction effects of three alternative touch screen scrolling methods for searching music tracks on a mobile device were studied in a driving simulation experiment with 24 participants. Page-by-page scrolling methods with Buttons or Swipe that better facilitate resumption of visual search following interruptions were expected to lead to more consistent in-vehicle glance durations and thus on less severe distraction effects than Kinetic scrolling. As predicted, Kinetic scrolling induced decreased visual sampling efficiency and increased visual load compared with Swipe, increased experienced workload compared with both Buttons and Swipe, as well as decreased lane-keeping accuracy compared with baseline. However, Buttons did not significantly excel Kinetic with any metric but on subjective ratings. Based on the results, we do not recommend the use of kinetic scrolling with in-vehicle touch screen displays in the manner used in the experiment. Instead, page-by-page swiping seems to suit significantly better for in-vehicle displays due to its systematic nature and low levels of pointing accuracy required for scrolling the pages.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this report was to conduct in-depth analyses of driver inattention using the driving data collected in the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study. An additional database of baseline epochs was reduced from the raw data and used in conjunction with the crash and near-crash data identified as part of the original 100-Car Study to account for exposure and establish near-crash/crash risk. The analyses presented in this report are able to establish direct relationships between driving behavior and crash and near-crash involvement. Risk was calculated (odds ratios) using both crash and near-crash data as well as normal baseline driving data for various sources of inattention. The corresponding population attributable risk percentages were also calculated to estimate the percentage of crashes and near-crashes occurring in the population resulting from inattention. Additional analyses involved: driver willingness to engage in distracting tasks or driving while drowsy; analyses with survey and test battery responses; and the impact of driver’s eyes being off of the forward roadway. The results indicated that driving while drowsy results in a four- to six-times higher near-crash/crash risk relative to alert drivers. Drivers engaging in visually and/or manually complex tasks have a three-times higher near-crash/crash risk than drivers who are attentive. There are specific environmental conditions in which engaging in secondary tasks or driving while drowsy is more dangerous, including intersections, wet roadways, and areas of high traffic density. Short, brief glances away from the forward roadway for the purpose of scanning the driving environment are safe and actually decrease near-crash/crash risk. Even in the cases of secondary task engagement, if the task is simple and requires a single short glance the risk is elevated only slightly, if at all. However, glances totaling more than 2 seconds for any purpose increase near-crash/crash risk by at least two times that of normal, baseline driving.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the teaching of digital design systems has been focused on the operative learning of software. However, this almost exclusively technical approach has leaded to a partial view of these systems, as well suited platforms to exploration of project’s possibilities. Consequently their relevance as a base for project representation and therefore as a useful instrument for conceptual exploration for design and experimental research of their processes have been undervalued. On the other hand, this restrictive perspective results in an important waste of the teaching possibilities lying in CAD software related with interdisciplinary teamwork. The following academic experience obeys to a new insight of how to teach these tools, based upon problem solving in Design by interdisciplinary students work teams from Architecture and Industrial Design. In this bet, the learning process is flexible, shared and collaborative, according to the requirements of each project, powered by the commitment of facing common goals. [Full paper in Spanish]},

Designers work in such systems at two levels: definition of schemata and constraints; and search within a schema collection for meaningful instances. Propagation-based systems yield efficient algorithms that are complete within their domain, require explicit specification of a directed acyclic constraint graph and allow relatively simple debugging strategies based on antecedents and consequents. The requirement to order constraints appears to be useful in expressing specific designer intentions and in disambiguating interaction. A key feature of such systems in practice appears to be a need for multiple views onto the constraint model and simultaneous interaction across views. We describe one multiple-view structure, its development and refinement through a large group of architecture practitioners and its realization in the system Generative Components.},

Subjunctive interfaces provide mechanisms for the parallel setup, viewing and control of scenarios, aiming to support users' thinking about and interaction with their choices. We illustrate how applications for information access, real-time simulation, and document design may be extended with these mechanisms. To investigate the usability of this form of extension, we compare a simple census browser against a version with a subjunctive interface. In the first of three studies, subjects reported higher satisfaction with the subjunctive interface, and relied less on interim marks on paper. No reduction in task completion time was found, however, mainly because some subjects encountered problems in setting up and controlling scenarios. At the end of a second, five-session study, users of a redesigned interface completed tasks 27\% more quickly than with the simple interface. In the third study we examined how subjects reasoned about multiple-scenario setups in pursuing complex, open-ended data explorations. Our main observation was that subjects treated scenarios as information holders, using them creatively in various ways to facilitate task completion.},

	abstract = {Knowledge discovery in multi-dimensional data is a challenging problem in engineering design. For example, in trade space exploration of large design data sets, designers need to select a subset of data of interest and examine data from different data dimensions and within data clusters at different granularities. This exploration is a process that demands both humans, who can heuristically decide what data to explore and how best to explore it, and computers, which can quickly extract features that may be of interest in the data. Thus, to support this process of knowledge discovery, we need tools that can go beyond traditional computer-oriented optimisation approaches and support advanced designer-centred trade space exploration and data interaction. This paper is an effort to address this need. In particular, we propose the interactive multiscale-nested clustering and aggregation framework to support trade space exploration of multi-dimensional data common to design optimisation. A system prototype of this framework is implemented to allow users to visually examine large design data sets through interactive data clustering, aggregation, and visualisation. The paper also presents an evaluation study involving morphing wing design using this prototype system.},

An important issue is how to find an optimised set of icons for different functions in terms of semantic distance. In an optimised icon set, every icon needs to be semantically as close as possible to the function it visually represents and semantically as far as possible from the other functions represented concurrently. In three experiments (N = 21 each), semantic distances of 19 icons to four menu functions were studied with preference rankings, verbal protocols, and the primed product comparisons method. The results show that the primed product comparisons method can be efficiently utilised for finding an optimised set of icons for time-critical applications out of a larger set of icons. The findings indicate the benefits of the novel methodological perspective into the icon design for safety-critical contexts in general.},

Existing research in this area suggests that the positive polarity advantage stems from the brighter illumination emitted by positive polarity displays, as opposed to the darker backgrounds of negative polarity displays. In the present study, legibility thresholds were measured under glance-like reading conditions using a lexical decision paradigm, testing two type sizes, display polarities, and ambient illuminations (near-dark and daylight-like). Results indicate that legibility thresholds, quantified as the amount of time needed to read a word accurately, were highest for the negative polarity configurations under dark ambient illumination, indicated worse performance. Conversely, the positive polarity conditions under dark ambient illumination and all conditions under bright illumination demonstrated significantly reduced thresholds, indicating greater legibility. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the “positive polarity advantage” arises because brighter illumination produces pupillary contraction that reduces optical aberrations as light enters the eye. These results have implications for the design of automotive interfaces and other scenarios in which an interface must be optimized for glance-like reading under variations in ambient lighting conditions.},

They first completed a baseline drive using a driving simulator with no secondary tasks followed by four drives under various conditions: HUD-Text, HUD-Grid, HDD-Text, and HDD-Grid. The study returned mixed results. HUDs generally contributed to more secondary task errors, but overall, users still preferred to use HUDs over HDDs. The response time to complete tasks was unevenly affected by display type. While there was no difference between response times in the grid tasks (HDD vs. HUD), the HUD was associated with significantly faster task performance as compared to the text tasks. These results suggest that HUDs may offer advantages to drivers in some task scenarios but more research is needed to understand under what conditions they do not add value.},

It determines the item the user intends to select, early in the pointing gesture, and accordingly simplifies-expedites the target acquisition. A study to evaluate the impact of using a predictive touchscreen in a car is then presented. The mid-air selection pointing facilitation scheme is applied, such that the user does not have to physically touch the interactive surface. Instead, the predictive display auto-selects the predicted interface icon on behalf of the user, once the required level of inference certainty is achieved. The study results, which are based on data collected from 20 participants under various driving-road conditions, demonstrate that a predictive display can significantly reduce the workload, effort and durations of completing on-screen selection tasks in vehicles.},

	abstract = {In-car infotainment systems require icons that enable fluent cognitive information processing and safe interaction while driving. An important issue is how to find an optimised set of icons for different functions in terms of semantic distance. In an optimised icon set, every icon needs to be semantically as close as possible to the function it visually represents and semantically as far as possible from the other functions represented concurrently. In three experiments (N = 21 each), semantic distances of 19 icons to four menu functions were studied with preference rankings, verbal protocols, and the primed product comparisons method. The results show that the primed product comparisons method can be efficiently utilised for finding an optimised set of icons for time-critical applications out of a larger set of icons. The findings indicate the benefits of the novel methodological perspective into the icon design for safety-critical contexts in general.},

Half of the participants had intensive driving experience, while the other half never driven a car. The results indicated that on average, word icons had a significantly greater matching accuracy than the other icon formats; ranging from 4.7 to 20.8\% difference. Regarding the matching sequence, participants matched image-related icons before other icon formats. Arbitrary and combined icons took significantly longer to match than other icon formats by 1.4–6.2 s. Based on the high matching accuracy (86.3\%) and high ratings on subjective design features, word format can be used for functions describable using simple English for users with English reading ability. Confusion matrices showed that 63.2\% of the misunderstandings were caused by similarity in format or function.},

In the current study, the layout of information on a visual display was manipulated to explore its effect on driving performance in the context of music selection. The comparative effects of an auditory–verbal (cognitive) task were also explored. The driving performance of 30 participants was assessed under both baseline and dual task conditions using the Lane Change Test. Concurrent completion of the music selection task with driving resulted in significant impairment to lateral driving performance (mean lane deviation and percentage of correct lane changes) relative to the baseline, and significantly greater mean lane deviation relative to the combined driving and the cognitive task condition. The magnitude of these effects on driving performance was independent of layout concept, although significant differences in subjective workload estimates and performance on the music selection task across layout concepts highlights that potential uncertainty regarding design use as conveyed through layout concept could be disadvantageous. The implications of these results for interface design and safety are discussed.},

Producing alternatives is a key feature of creative work, yet it is not strongly supported in most extant tools. GEM-NI enables various forms of exploration with alternatives such as parallel editing, recalling history, branching, merging, comparing, and Cartesian products of and for alternatives. Further, GEM-NI provides a modal graphical user interface and a design gallery, which both allow designers to control and manage their design exploration. We conducted an exploratory user study followed by in-depth one-on-one interviews with moderately and highly skills participants and obtained positive feedback for the system features, showing that GEM-NI supports creative design work well.},

	abstract = {This study explored the validity of using a low-cost simulator for the assessment of driver distraction arising from the use of an in-vehicle information system. Eighteen participants drove on a rural road whilst carrying out distractor tasks of various levels of difficulty, in both a low-cost simulator (with gaming console steering wheel and pedals with single monitor display) and a medium-cost one (fixed-base, complete vehicle cab, wrap-around visuals). The distractor tasks were presented at identical locations in each of the drives and an identical suite of driver performance and subjective rating measures were elicited to allow a robust comparison between the two simulator environments. As expected, there was a reduction in mean speed when drivers were completing the distraction tasks and this effect was observed in both simulators. However, drivers spent more time at shorter headways in the low-cost version and demonstrated more erratic steering behaviour in the low-cost version. This could be due to a reduced peripheral view and inferior kinaesthetic feedback through the driver controls, but low-cost simulators could play a significant role in the early stages of design and evaluation of in-vehicle information systems.},

However, current interface design tools focus on creating single artifacts. This paper introduces the Juxtapose code editor and runtime environment for designing multiple alternatives of both application logic and interface parameters. For rapidly comparing code alternatives, Juxtapose introduces selectively parallel source editing and execution. To explore parameter variations, Juxtapose automatically creates control interfaces for "tuning" application variables at runtime. This paper describes techniques to support design exploration for desktop, mobile, and physical interfaces, and situates this work in a larger design space of tools for explorative programming. A summative study of Juxtapose with 18 participants demonstrated that parallel editing and execution are accessible to interaction designers and that designers can leverage these techniques to survey more options, faster.},

Participants read electronic maps displayed in the center console while both parked and driving. In separate trials, the visual demand/workload of the same straight and curved sections was measured using the visual occlusion technique. Visual demand was correlated with inverse curve radius. As visual demand increased, driving performance declined. Participants made shorter glances at the display, made more of them, but waited longer between glances. Overall, task completion time increased when the task was performed while driving (versus while parked), except for short duration tasks (a single glance or under 3 seconds timed while parked), where task time decreased. While driving, task completion times were relatively unaffected by the driving workload. INTRODUCTION TEST PLAN Recently, there has been a proliferation of in-vehicle telematics systems and functions. This proliferation should continue into the Test Participants future (Richardson and Green, 2000), though to a large degree, continued growth depends upon successfully addressing concerns of Sixteen licensed drivers participated in this experiment, 8},

	abstract = {Nowadays the web map (E-map) is an indispensable wayfinding tool in the Internet-based society. However, its usability will vary with a different navigational technique or input device. The navigational techniques currently adopted by various web maps were investigated and analyzed. Moreover, two input devices, i.e., the mouse and the touch screen, were operated in four navigational techniques to study the differences in their functions and performances. Later, the research findings were utilized to develop a new navigational technique. The research was divided into two stages. During the first stage, all the navigational techniques in current use were investigated and compared. Then, based on the results of analysis, the enhanced navigator with continuous control (ENCC) was designed. During the second stage, the searching and browsing techniques of different web maps were simulated. Afterwards, the mouse and the touch screen were employed separately to conduct simulation tests in the following navigational techniques: (1) combined panning buttons (CPB), (2) distributed panning buttons (DPB), (3) ENCC, and (4) G\&D. A total of 36 participants took part in the trials. At the end of the experiment, the operational performances of the participants were studied through the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); besides, the subjective evaluation questionnaires were answered. It was discovered that the mouse did better than the touch screen in the four navigational techniques. Besides, among the four techniques, ENCC showed the best performance. Capable of continuous control and continuous display, the ENCC interface was upgraded in terms of operational speed and directional control. The findings can be used as a reference in the design of web maps. Also, it is suggested that ENCC should be widely applied to touch screens and mice so that the navigation of information space may be facilitated.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of attention to visual warnings is a representation of the adaptive behavior of humans. However, the ways warning icons attract attention in the cognition context has yet to be clarified. This research aims to investigate cognitive mechanism of warning icons under various perceptual loads. The results of Experiment A, whose average attentional capture effect of the warning icons (69 ms) was significantly higher than that of the ordinary icons (35 ms), show that compared with ordinary icons, warning icons are prioritized in processing under both high and low perceptual loads. Besides, the attention capturing abilities of non-target warning icons are the same under high and low perceptual loads. To isolate the effects of salient visual features and semantics, warning icons in Experiment B are replaced with transposed icons with saliency but no semantics. The attentional capture effect of warning icons is found to be significantly smaller under high load than under low load, so the effect in Experiment A can be attributed to the semantics of warning icons. In Experiment C the icons of negative and neutral semantics without salient frames are used as interfering stimuli, and the RT to the negative icons (823 ms) was longer than both the RT to the neutral icons (780 ms) and to the no interference icons (743 ms) (P {\textless} 0.001), which show that negative icons have stronger attention capturing ability than neutral icons. This research verifies that the semantics of icons is vital, and icons with salient visual features and negative semantics can enhance attentional capture effect.},

	abstract = {To ensure safety and usability of automotive user interfaces, prospective validations during early prototyping stages are important, especially when developing innovative human-cockpit interactions (HCI). Real car driving studies are difficult to control, manipulate, replicate, and standardize. Additionally, compared to other study designs, they are also time consuming and expensive. One economizing approach is the implementation of immersive driving environments in simulator studies to provide users a more realistic awareness of the situation. Using simulator test environments puts the question of driving simulator validity forward, meaning the extent to which results generated in simulated environments can be transferred to real world environments. Thus, in this chapter the ‘Immersive model-based HCI validation method’, which was developed by the authors, will be introduced. First, the state of the art of driving simulators will be analyzed. For this, the authors defined the degree of fidelity based on the used elements. Next, findings of a series of driving simulator tests will be presented, which investigate the influence of immersive parameters in driving environments. Visual and auditory immersive parameters were used to analyze the validity of driving simulator environments, as well as different technologies (HMD, holobench, PC). Different levels of immersion (from low to high fidelity) were tested to examine this methodology. Thus, main intention was to demonstrate the generalizability and transferability of the ‘Immersive model-based HCI validation method’ for different use cases. Objective and subjective data show advantages regarding the situational awareness and perception for highly immersive driving environments while interacting with a navigation system.},

The conceptual design goal was to maintain a pleasurable situational awareness of the inactive driver by integrating the driving context as a meaningful input into the interaction system. In this chapter, we introduce the design of three experimental applications for autonomous driving and report on explorative user studies conducted to investigate the impact of the three AutoPlay prototypes: AutoGym, an in-car exertion game that translates car speed and traffic situations into an individual exercise program. AutoJam, a touch sensitive steering wheel cover to generate interactive music experiences in a creative interplay with car’s driving dynamics. AutoRoute, a discovery application for future urban commuting in autonomous cars that enables an exploration of the city based on spontaneous routing and rerouting. Furthermore, we reflect on the outcome of the user studies and propose three motivational affordances of autonomous driving: drivability, performability, and explorability. Each of these concepts, help to understand the motivational possibilities of the autonomous driving situation and facilitates a meaningful alignment of interaction systems and the driving context. We discuss the underlying concepts of the three affordances by relating them to the experiences identified in the user studies. Subsequently the contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) We introduce the AutoPlay prototypes as inspirational concepts for aligning non-driving activities with the autonomous driving context and (2) we propose three motivational affordances as design targets for the implementation of non-driving activities in order to initiate a broader discussion on the pleasures of autonomous driving beyond instrumental motives.},

	abstract = {The long awaited arrival of automated driving technology has the automotive industry perched on the precipice of radical change when it comes to the design of vehicle interiors and user experience. Recently, much thinking and many vehicle concepts have been devoted to demonstrating how vehicle interiors might change when vehicles reach full automation, where a human driver is neither required nor in some cases, even allowed to control the vehicle. However, looking more near term across all global market segments, we will likely see an increasing number of vehicles with widely varying automation capabilities emerging simultaneously. Any system short of full automation will still require driver control in some set of situations, and some fully automated vehicles will still allow driver control when desired. While it is unlikely that the basic seating arrangement, steering wheel, and pedals will be radically altered in this emerging segment of partial to highly automated vehicles, it is quite clear that the overall user experience during automated driving will need to evolve. Drivers will not be content to hold the steering wheel and stare at the road waiting for what may be a very infrequent request to take-over driving. The chapter presents the research conducted to develop the Valeo Mobius® Intuitive Driving solution for providing an embedded digital experience, even in lower levels of automation, and all while still promoting both shorter transition response times and better transition quality when emergency situations call for a transition from automated to manual control.},

While M\&B massed their static and expanding targets in separate blocks of trials, thus making expansion predictable for participants, we replicated their experiment with one new condition in which the target could unpredictably expand, shrink, or stay unchanged. Our results show that target expansion occurring as late as in M\&B's experiment enhances pointing performance in the absence of expectation. We discuss these findings in terms of the basic human processes that underlie target-acquisition movements, and we address the implications for user interface design by introducing a revised design for the Mac OS X Dock.},

Experimental research in human-computer interaction involves varying the design or deployment of systems, observing the consequences, and inferring from observations what to do differently. For such research to be effective, it must be owned—instituted, trusted and heeded—by those who control the development of new systems. Thus, managers, marketers, systems engineers, project leaders, and designers as well as human factors specialists are important participants in behavioral human-computer interaction research. This chapter is intended as much for those with backgrounds in computer science, engineering, or management as for human factors researchers and cognitive systems designers. It is argued in this chapter that the special goals and difficulties of human-computer interaction research make it different from most psychological research as well as from traditional computer engineering research. The main goal, the improvement of complex, interacting human-computer systems, requires behavioral research but is not sufficiently served by the standard tools of experimental psychology such as factorial controlled experiments on pre-planned variables. The chapter contains about equal quantities of criticism of inappropriate general research methods, description of valuable methods, and prescription of specific useful techniques.},

This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration.},

	volume = {86},
	issn = {0002-9165},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute consumption of fat-free fluid milk after resistance exercise promotes a greater positive protein balance than does soy protein.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the long-term consequences of milk or soy protein or equivalent energy consumption on training-induced lean mass accretion.
DESIGN: We recruited 56 healthy young men who trained 5 d/wk for 12 wk on a rotating split-body resistance exercise program in a parallel 3-group longitudinal design. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume drinks immediately and again 1 h after exercise: fat-free milk (Milk; n = 18); fat-free soy protein (Soy; n = 19) that was isoenergetic, isonitrogenous, and macronutrient ratio matched to Milk; or maltodextrin that was isoenergetic with Milk and Soy (control group; n = 19).
RESULTS: Muscle fiber size, maximal strength, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were measured before and after training. No between-group differences were seen in strength. Type II muscle fiber area increased in all groups with training, but with greater increases in the Milk group than in both the Soy and control groups (P {\textless} 0.05). Type I muscle fiber area increased after training only in the Milk and Soy groups, with the increase in the Milk group being greater than that in the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). DXA-measured fat- and bone-free mass increased in all groups, with a greater increase in the Milk group than in both the Soy and control groups (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that chronic postexercise consumption of milk promotes greater hypertrophy during the early stages of resistance training in novice weightlifters when compared with isoenergetic soy or carbohydrate consumption.},

	title = {Dietary protein to support anabolism with resistance exercise in young men},
	volume = {24},
	issn = {0731-5724},
	abstract = {Resistance exercise is fundamentally anabolic and as such stimulates the process of skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in an absolute sense and relative to skeletal muscle protein breakdown (MPB). However, the net effect of resistance exercise is to shift net protein balance (NPB = MPS - MPB) to a more positive value; however, in the absence of feeding NPB remains negative. Feeding stimulates MPS to an extent where NPB becomes positive, for a transient time. When combined, resistance exercise and feeding synergistically interact to result in NPB being greater than with feeding alone. This feeding- and exercise-induced stimulation of NPB is what, albeit slowly, results in muscle hypertrophy. With this rudimentary knowledge we are now at the point where we can manipulate variables within the system to see what impact these interventions have on the processes of MPS, MPB, and NPB and ultimately and perhaps most importantly, muscle hypertrophy and strength. We used established models of skeletal muscle amino acid turnover to examine how protein source (milk versus soy) acutely affects the processes of MPS and MPB after resistance exercise. Our findings revealed that even when balanced quantities of total protein and energy are consumed that milk proteins are more effective in stimulating amino acid uptake and net protein deposition in skeletal muscle after resistance exercise than are hydrolyzed soy proteins. Importantly, the finding of increased amino acid uptake would be independent of the differences in amino acid composition of the two proteins. We propose that the improved net protein deposition with milk protein consumption is also not due to differences in amino acid composition, but is due to a different pattern of amino acid delivery associated with milk versus hydrolyzed soy proteins. If our acute findings are accurate then we hypothesized that chronically the greater net protein deposition associated with milk protein consumption post-resistance exercise would eventually lead to greater net protein accretion (i.e., muscle fiber hypertrophy), over a longer time period. In young men completing 12 weeks of resistance training (5d/wk) we observed a tendency (P = 0.11) for greater gains in whole body lean mass and whole as greater muscle fiber hypertrophy with consumption of milk. While strength gains were not different between the soy and milk-supplemented groups we would argue that the true significance of a greater increase in lean mass that we observed with milk consumption may be more important in groups of persons with lower initial lean mass and strength such as the elderly.},

	abstract = {When consumed separately, whey protein (WP) is more rapidly absorbed into circulation than casein (Cas), which prompted the concept of rapid and slow dietary protein. It is unclear whether these proteins have similar metabolic fates when coingested as in milk. We determined the rate of appearance across the splanchnic bed and the rate of disappearance across the leg of phenylalanine (Phe) from coingested, intrinsically labeled WP and Cas. Either [¹⁵N]Phe or [¹³C-ring C₆]Phe was infused in lactating cows, and the labeled WP and Cas from their milk were collected. To determine the fate of Phe derived from different protein sources, 18 healthy participants were studied after ingestion of one of the following: 1) [¹⁵N]WP, [¹³C]Cas, and lactose; 2) [¹³C]WP, [¹⁵N]Cas, and lactose; 3) lactose alone. At 80-120 min, the rates of appearance (R(a)) across the splanchnic bed of Phe from WP and Cas were similar [0.068 ± 0.010 vs. 0.070 ± 0.009\%/min; not significant (ns)]. At time 220-260 min, Phe appearance from WP had slowed (0.039 ± 0.008\%/min, P {\textless} 0.05) whereas Phe appearance from Cas was sustained (0.068 ± 0.013\%/min). Similarly, accretion rates across the leg of Phe absorbed from WP and Cas were not different at 80-120 min (0.011 ± 0.002 vs. 0.012 ± 0.003\%/min; ns), but they were significantly lower for WP (0.007 ± 0.002\%/min) at 220-260 min than for Cas (0.013 ± 0.002\%/min) at 220-260 min. Early after meal ingestion, amino acid absorption and retention across the leg were similar for WP and Cas, but as rates for WP waned, absorption and assimilation into skeletal muscle were better retained for Cas.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Studies that have attributed gains in lean body mass to dietary supplementation during resistance exercise (RE) training have not reported these changes alongside adaptations at the cellular and subcellular levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two popular supplements--whey protein (WP) and creatine monohydrate (CrM) (both separately and in combination)--on body composition, muscle strength, fiber-specific hypertrophy (i.e., type I, IIa, IIx), and contractile protein accrual during RE training.
METHODS: In a double-blind randomized protocol, resistance-trained males were matched for strength and placed into one of four groups: creatine/carbohydrate (CrCHO), creatine/whey protein (CrWP), WP only, or carbohydrate only (CHO) (1.5 g x kg(-1) body weight per day). All assessments were completed the week before and after an 11-wk structured, supervised RE program. Assessments included strength (1RM, three exercises), body composition (DEXA), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies for determination of muscle fiber type (I, IIa, IIx), cross-sectional area (CSA), contractile protein, and creatine (Cr) content.
RESULTS: Supplementation with CrCHO, WP, and CrWP resulted in significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.05) 1RM strength improvements (three of three assessments) and muscle hypertrophy compared with CHO. Up to 76\% of the strength improvements in the squat could be attributed to hypertrophy of muscle involved in this exercise. However, the hypertrophy responses within these groups varied at the three levels assessed (i.e., changes in lean mass, fiber-specific hypertrophy, and contractile protein content).
CONCLUSIONS: Although WP and/or CrM seem to promote greater strength gains and muscle morphology during RE training, the hypertrophy responses within the groups varied. These differences in skeletal muscle morphology may have important implications for various populations and, therefore, warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Exercise has a profound effect on muscle growth, which can occur only if muscle protein synthesis exceeds muscle protein breakdown; there must be a positive muscle protein balance. Resistance exercise improves muscle protein balance, but, in the absence of food intake, the balance remains negative (i.e., catabolic). The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts for 24-48 hours; thus, the interaction between protein metabolism and any meals consumed in this period will determine the impact of the diet on muscle hypertrophy. Amino acid availability is an important regulator of muscle protein metabolism. The interaction of postexercise metabolic processes and increased amino acid availability maximizes the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and results in even greater muscle anabolism than when dietary amino acids are not present. Hormones, especially insulin and testosterone, have important roles as regulators of muscle protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy. Following exercise, insulin has only a permissive role on muscle protein synthesis, but it appears to inhibit the increase in muscle protein breakdown. Ingestion of only small amounts of amino acids, combined with carbohydrates, can transiently increase muscle protein anabolism, but it has yet to be determined if these transient responses translate into an appreciable increase in muscle mass over a prolonged training period.},

However, less is known about the long-term hypertrophic effect of protein supplementation in combination with resistance training. The present study was designed to compare the effect of 14 weeks of resistance training combined with timed ingestion of isoenergetic protein vs carbohydrate supplementation on muscle fiber hypertrophy and mechanical muscle performance. Supplementation was administered before and immediately after each training bout and, in addition, in the morning on nontraining days. Muscle biopsy specimens were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle and analyzed for muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Squat jump and countermovement jump were performed on a force platform to determine vertical jump height. Peak torque during slow (30 degrees s-1) and fast (240 degrees s-1) concentric and eccentric contractions of the knee extensor muscle was measured in an isokinetic dynamometer. After 14 weeks of resistance training, the protein group showed hypertrophy of type I (18\% +/- 5\%; P {\textless} .01) and type II (26\% +/- 5\%; P {\textless} .01) muscle fibers, whereas no change above baseline occurred in the carbohydrate group. Squat jump height increased only in the protein group, whereas countermovement jump height and peak torque during slow isokinetic muscle contraction increased similarly in both groups. In conclusion, a minor advantage of protein supplementation over carbohydrate supplementation during resistance training on mechanical muscle function was found.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Some studies report greater muscle hypertrophy during resistance exercise (RE) training from supplement timing (i.e., the strategic consumption of protein and carbohydrate before and/or after each workout). However, no studies have examined whether this strategy provides greater muscle hypertrophy or strength development compared with supplementation at other times during the day. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of supplement timing compared with supplementation in the hours not close to the workout on muscle-fiber hypertrophy, strength, and body composition during a 10-wk RE program.
METHODS: In a single-blind, randomized protocol, resistance-trained males were matched for strength and placed into one of two groups; the PRE-POST group consumed a supplement (1 g x kg(-1) body weight) containing protein/creatine/glucose immediately before and after RE. The MOR-EVE group consumed the same dose of the same supplement in the morning and late evening. All assessments were completed the week before and after 10 wk of structured, supervised RE training. Assessments included strength (1RM, three exercises), body composition (DEXA), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies for determination of muscle fiber type (I, IIa, IIx), cross-sectional area (CSA), contractile protein, creatine (Cr), and glycogen content.
RESULTS: PRE-POST demonstrated a greater (P {\textless} 0.05) increase in lean body mass and 1RM strength in two of three assessments. The changes in body composition were supported by a greater (P {\textless} 0.05) increase in CSA of the type II fibers and contractile protein content. PRE-POST supplementation also resulted in higher muscle Cr and glycogen values after the training program (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Supplement timing represents a simple but effective strategy that enhances the adaptations desired from RE-training.},

This finding has led to the concept that there is a maximal anabolic response to protein intake with a meal, and that the normal amount of protein eaten with dinner will generally exceed the maximally-effective intake of protein., However, protein breakdown has not been taken into account when evaluating the anabolic response to protein intake. Protein anabolism occurs only when protein synthesis exceeds breakdown protein breakdown., Higher protein intakes when protein synthesis is maximized is characterized by suppressed protein breakdown and via that mechanism leads to a greater anabolic response. This explains why when net protein synthesis is measured, the relationship between amino acid availability and net gain remains linear, without any apparent plateau of effect at higher levels of availability., We conclude that there is no practical upper limit to the anabolic response to protein or amino acid intake in the context of a meal.},

The following points summarize the position of the ISSN:Nutrient timing incorporates the use of methodical planning and eating of whole foods, fortified foods and dietary supplements. The timing of energy intake and the ratio of certain ingested macronutrients may enhance recovery and tissue repair, augment muscle protein synthesis (MPS), and improve mood states following high-volume or intense exercise.Endogenous glycogen stores are maximized by following a high-carbohydrate diet (8-12 g of carbohydrate/kg/day [g/kg/day]); moreover, these stores are depleted most by high volume exercise.If rapid restoration of glycogen is required ({\textless} 4 h of recovery time) then the following strategies should be considered:aggressive carbohydrate refeeding (1.2 g/kg/h) with a preference towards carbohydrate sources that have a high ({\textgreater} 70) glycemic indexthe addition of caffeine (3-8 mg/kg)combining carbohydrates (0.8 g/kg/h) with protein (0.2-0.4 g/kg/h) Extended ({\textgreater} 60 min) bouts of high intensity ({\textgreater} 70\% VO2max) exercise challenge fuel supply and fluid regulation, thus carbohydrate should be consumed at a rate of {\textasciitilde}30-60 g of carbohydrate/h in a 6-8\% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (6-12 fluid ounces) every 10-15 min throughout the entire exercise bout, particularly in those exercise bouts that span beyond 70 min. When carbohydrate delivery is inadequate, adding protein may help increase performance, ameliorate muscle damage, promote euglycemia and facilitate glycogen re-synthesis.Carbohydrate ingestion throughout resistance exercise (e.g., 3-6 sets of 8-12 repetition maximum [RM] using multiple exercises targeting all major muscle groups) has been shown to promote euglycemia and higher glycogen stores. Consuming carbohydrate solely or in combination with protein during resistance exercise increases muscle glycogen stores, ameliorates muscle damage, and facilitates greater acute and chronic training adaptations.Meeting the total daily intake of protein, preferably with evenly spaced protein feedings (approximately every 3 h during the day), should be viewed as a primary area of emphasis for exercising individuals.Ingestion of essential amino acids (EAA; approximately 10 g)either in free form or as part of a protein bolus of approximately 20-40 g has been shown to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS).Pre- and/or post-exercise nutritional interventions (carbohydrate + protein or protein alone) may operate as an effective strategy to support increases in strength and improvements in body composition. However, the size and timing of a pre-exercise meal may impact the extent to which post-exercise protein feeding is required.Post-exercise ingestion (immediately to 2-h post) of high-quality protein sources stimulates robust increases in MPS.In non-exercising scenarios, changing the frequency of meals has shown limited impact on weight loss and body composition, with stronger evidence to indicate meal frequency can favorably improve appetite and satiety. More research is needed to determine the influence of combining an exercise program with altered meal frequencies on weight loss and body composition with preliminary research indicating a potential benefit.Ingesting a 20-40 g protein dose (0.25-0.40 g/kg body mass/dose) of a high-quality source every three to 4 h appears to most favorably affect MPS rates when compared to other dietary patterns and is associated with improved body composition and performance outcomes.Consuming casein protein ({\textasciitilde} 30-40 g) prior to sleep can acutely increase MPS and metabolic rate throughout the night without influencing lipolysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that for older adults evenly distributing consumption of protein at 30-40 g per meal throughout the day may result in more favorable retention of lean mass and muscular strength. Such a thesis has not, to our knowledge, been tested outside of short-term studies or acute measures of muscle protein synthesis.
AIMS: To examine whether the number of times an individual consumed a minimum of 30 g of protein at a meal is associated with leg lean mass and knee extensor strength.
METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES were used, with 1081 adults (50-85 y) constituting the analytic sample. A "multiple pass" 24-h dietary interview format was used to collect detailed information about the participants' dietary intake. Knee extensor strength was assessed objectively using the Kin Com MP dynamometer. Leg lean mass was estimated from whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.
RESULTS: Participants with 1 vs. 0 (βadjusted = 23.6, p = 0.002) and 2 vs. 0 (βadjusted = 51.1, p = 0.001) meals of ≥30 g protein/meal had greater strength and leg lean mass (1 vs. 0, βadjusted = 1160, p {\textless} 0.05 and 2 vs. 0, βadjusted = 2389, p {\textless} 0.05). The association of protein frequency with leg lean mass and strength plateaued at ∼45 g protein/meal for those consuming 2 vs. 0 meals above the evaluated protein/meal threshold. However, for those with only 1 meal at or above the evaluated threshold, the response plateaued at 30 g/meal. Leg lean mass mediated the relationship between protein frequency and strength, with the proportion of the total effect mediated being 64\%.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that more frequent consumption of meals containing between 30 and 45 g protein/meal produced the greatest association with leg lean mass and strength. Thus, the consumption of 1-2 daily meals with protein content from 30 to 45 g may be an important strategy for increasing and/or maintaining lean body mass and muscle strength with aging.},

	abstract = {Opinion on the role of protein in promoting athletic performance is divided along the lines of how much aerobic-based versus resistance-based activity the athlete undertakes. Athletes seeking to gain muscle mass and strength are likely to consume higher amounts of dietary protein than their endurance-trained counterparts. The main belief behind the large quantities of dietary protein consumption in resistance-trained athletes is that it is needed to generate more muscle protein. Athletes may require protein for more than just alleviation of the risk for deficiency, inherent in the dietary guidelines, but also to aid in an elevated level of functioning and possibly adaptation to the exercise stimulus. It does appear, however, that there is a good rationale for recommending to athletes protein intakes that are higher than the RDA. Our consensus opinion is that leucine, and possibly the other branched-chain amino acids, occupy a position of prominence in stimulating muscle protein synthesis; that protein intakes in the range of 1.3-1.8 g · kg(-1) · day(-1) consumed as 3-4 isonitrogenous meals will maximize muscle protein synthesis. These recommendations may also be dependent on training status: experienced athletes would require less, while more protein should be consumed during periods of high frequency/intensity training. Elevated protein consumption, as high as 1.8-2.0 g · kg(-1) · day(-1) depending on the caloric deficit, may be advantageous in preventing lean mass losses during periods of energy restriction to promote fat loss.},

	abstract = {The popularity of natural bodybuilding is increasing; however, evidence-based recommendations for it are lacking. This paper reviewed the scientific literature relevant to competition preparation on nutrition and supplementation, resulting in the following recommendations. Caloric intake should be set at a level that results in bodyweight losses of approximately 0.5 to 1\%/wk to maximize muscle retention. Within this caloric intake, most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming 2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30\% of calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from carbohydrate. Eating three to six meals per day with a meal containing 0.4-0.5 g/kg bodyweight of protein prior and subsequent to resistance training likely maximizes any theoretical benefits of nutrient timing and frequency. However, alterations in nutrient timing and frequency appear to have little effect on fat loss or lean mass retention. Among popular supplements, creatine monohydrate, caffeine and beta-alanine appear to have beneficial effects relevant to contest preparation, however others do not or warrant further study. The practice of dehydration and electrolyte manipulation in the final days and hours prior to competition can be dangerous, and may not improve appearance. Increasing carbohydrate intake at the end of preparation has a theoretical rationale to improve appearance, however it is understudied. Thus, if carbohydrate loading is pursued it should be practiced prior to competition and its benefit assessed individually.

	abstract = {Controversy exists about the maximum amount of protein that can be utilized for lean tissue-building purposes in a single meal for those involved in regimented resistance training. It has been proposed that muscle protein synthesis is maximized in young adults with an intake of {\textasciitilde} 20-25 g of a high-quality protein; anything above this amount is believed to be oxidized for energy or transaminated to form urea and other organic acids. However, these findings are specific to the provision of fast-digesting proteins without the addition of other macronutrients. Consumption of slower-acting protein sources, particularly when consumed in combination with other macronutrients, would delay absorption and thus conceivably enhance the utilization of the constituent amino acids. The purpose of this paper was twofold: 1) to objectively review the literature in an effort to determine an upper anabolic threshold for per-meal protein intake; 2) draw relevant conclusions based on the current data so as to elucidate guidelines for per-meal daily protein distribution to optimize lean tissue accretion. Both acute and long-term studies on the topic were evaluated and their findings placed into context with respect to per-meal utilization of protein and the associated implications to distribution of protein feedings across the course of a day. The preponderance of data indicate that while consumption of higher protein doses ({\textgreater} 20 g) results in greater AA oxidation, this is not the fate for all the additional ingested AAs as some are utilized for tissue-building purposes. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that to maximize anabolism one should consume protein at a target intake of 0.4 g/kg/meal across a minimum of four meals in order to reach aminimumof 1.6 g/kg/day. Using the upper daily intake of 2.2 g/kg/day reported in the literature spread out over the same four meals would necessitate a maximum of 0.55 g/kg/meal.},

A problem with parameter tweaking is that it often requires much time and effort to explore a high-dimensional parameter space. We present a new technique to analyze such high-dimensional parameter space to obtain a distribution of human preference. Our method uses crowdsourcing to gather pairwise comparisons between various parameter sets. As a result of analysis, the user obtains a goodness function that computes the goodness value of a given parameter set. This goodness function enables two interfaces for exploration: Smart Suggestion, which provides suggestions of preferable parameter sets, and VisOpt Slider, which interactively visualizes the distribution of goodness values on sliders and gently optimizes slider values while the user is editing. We created four applications with different design parameter spaces. As a result, the system could facilitate the user's design exploration.},

Early stage design decisions influence significantly the final performance of a building and designers are often unable to explore large numbers of design alternatives with respect to the performative criteria set for the project. This research outlines a "creative optimization workflow' using a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) engine called Octopus that runs within Grasshopper3D, a parametric modeling tool, and simulation software DIVA for daylight factor analysis. The workflow utilizes a "creative optimization tool' which allows the designer to explore, sort and filter solutions, and analyze both quantitatively and qualitatively the trade-offs of the resultant design solution space. It enables the designer to visually compare alternative solutions in a gallery and subsequently analyze trade-offs through a radar-based chart, parallel coordinate plot graphs and conditional domain searches. This feedback tools allows the designer to quickly and efficiently identify potential solutions for either design development or to select preferred solutions for further optimization, i.e. "optimizing creatively'. A retrospective design case study, the "De Rotterdam' building, is used to demonstrate the application of the tools. The workflow demonstrates the ability to reduce design latency and to allow for better understanding of design solutions. Additional research is needed to better understand the application of MOO in the early stages of design; and the further improvement of the creative optimization tools to accommodate the designer's need for a more dynamic and synergistic process.},

To support answering questions quickly, we introduce a general approach for intelligently recruiting human workers in advance called quikTurkit so that workers are available when new questions arrive. A ﬁeld deployment with 11 blind participants illustrates that blind people can effectively use VizWiz to cheaply answer questions in their everyday lives, highlighting issues that automatic approaches will need to address to be useful.

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle is critical for human health. Protein feeding, alongside resistance exercise, is a potent stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and is a key factor that regulates skeletal muscle mass (SMM). The main purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate the latest evidence for optimising the amino acid or protein source, dose, timing, pattern and macronutrient coingestion for increasing or preserving SMM in healthy young and healthy older adults. We used a systematic search strategy of PubMed and Web of Science to retrieve all articles related to this review objective. In summary, our findings support the notion that protein guidelines for increasing or preserving SMM are more complex than simply recommending a total daily amount of protein. Instead, multifactorial interactions between protein source, dose, timing, pattern and macronutrient coingestion, alongside exercise, influence the stimulation of MPS, and thus should be considered in the context of protein recommendations for regulating SMM. To conclude, on the basis of currently available scientific literature, protein recommendations for optimising SMM should be tailored to the population or context of interest, with consideration given to age and resting/post resistance exercise conditions.},

OBJECTIVE: We characterized the dose-response relation of postabsorptive rates of myofibrillar MPS to increasing amounts of whey protein at rest and after exercise in resistance-trained, young men.
DESIGN: Volunteers (n = 48) consumed a standardized, high-protein (0.54 g/kg body mass) breakfast. Three hours later, a bout of unilateral exercise (8 × 10 leg presses and leg extensions; 80\% one-repetition maximum) was performed. Volunteers ingested 0, 10, 20, or 40 g whey protein isolate immediately ({\textasciitilde}10 min) after exercise. Postabsorptive rates of myofibrillar MPS and whole-body rates of phenylalanine oxidation and urea production were measured over a 4-h postdrink period by continuous tracer infusion of labeled [(13)C6] phenylalanine and [(15)N2] urea.
RESULTS: Myofibrillar MPS (mean ± SD) increased (P {\textless} 0.05) above 0 g whey protein (0.041 ± 0.015\%/h) by 49\% and 56\% with the ingestion of 20 and 40 g whey protein, respectively, whereas no additional stimulation was observed with 10 g whey protein (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Rates of phenylalanine oxidation and urea production increased with the ingestion of 40 g whey protein.
CONCLUSIONS: A 20-g dose of whey protein is sufficient for the maximal stimulation of postabsorptive rates of myofibrillar MPS in rested and exercised muscle of {\textasciitilde}80-kg resistance-trained, young men. A dose of whey protein {\textgreater}20 g stimulates amino acid oxidation and ureagenesis. This trial was registered at http://www.isrctn.org/ as ISRCTN92528122.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anabolic effect of resistance exercise is enhanced by the provision of dietary protein.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the ingested protein dose response of muscle (MPS) and albumin protein synthesis (APS) after resistance exercise. In addition, we measured the phosphorylation of candidate signaling proteins thought to regulate acute changes in MPS.
DESIGN: Six healthy young men reported to the laboratory on 5 separate occasions to perform an intense bout of leg-based resistance exercise. After exercise, participants consumed, in a randomized order, drinks containing 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 g whole egg protein. Protein synthesis and whole-body leucine oxidation were measured over 4 h after exercise by a primed constant infusion of [1-(13)C]leucine.
RESULTS: MPS displayed a dose response to dietary protein ingestion and was maximally stimulated at 20 g. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (Thr(389)), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser(240/244)), and the epsilon-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (Ser(539)) were unaffected by protein ingestion. APS increased in a dose-dependent manner and also reached a plateau at 20 g ingested protein. Leucine oxidation was significantly increased after 20 and 40 g protein were ingested.
CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of 20 g intact protein is sufficient to maximally stimulate MPS and APS after resistance exercise. Phosphorylation of candidate signaling proteins was not enhanced with any dose of protein ingested, which suggested that the stimulation of MPS after resistance exercise may be related to amino acid availability. Finally, dietary protein consumed after exercise in excess of the rate at which it can be incorporated into tissue protein stimulates irreversible oxidation.},

We present the results of three studies, finding that independent raters prefer designs created with the aid of examples, that examples may benefit novices more than experienced designers, that users prefer adaptively selected examples to random ones, and that users make use of multiple examples when creating new designs. To enable these studies and demonstrate how software tools can facilitate designing with examples, we introduce interface techniques for browsing and borrowing from a corpus of examples, manifest in the Adaptive Ideas Web design tool.

Unlike traditional computer aided design, where users create a single model, with generative design, users specify high-level goals and constraints, and the system automatically generates hundreds or thousands of candidates all meeting the design criteria. Once a large collection of design variations is created, the designer is left with the task of finding the design, or set of designs, which best meets their requirements. This is a complicated task which could require analyzing the structural characteristics and visual aesthetics of the designs. Two studies are conducted which demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the Dream Lens system, and a generatively designed dataset of 16,800 designs for a sample design problem is described and publicly released to encourage advancement in this area.},

An experiment was conducted to study the effects of goals and methods on design process and design solutions by 16 individual designers, who performed two design tasks under different combination of design goal and method specifications. Protocol analysis and outcome-based analysis were carried out. The results of the outcome-based analysis reveal that the quality of the design solutions can greatly be affected by goal specificity level of a design task, whereas in case of quantity, novelty and designer’s self satisfaction level, the effects are insignificant. None of these metrics showed significant influence of method specificity levels of a design task. The process-based analysis on the other hand, reveals some interesting search behaviors in parametric systems, which are then used to explain the possible reasons for insignificance in quantitative data.},

Conventional multivariate visualization techniques generally do not scale well with respect to the size of the data set. The focus of this paper is on the interactive visualization of large multivariate data sets based on a number of novel extensions to the parallel coordinates display technique. We develop a multiresolutional view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and use a variation on parallel coordinates to convey aggregation information for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until the desired focus region and level of detail is reached, using our suite of navigational and filtering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel coordinates system which is based on extending the XmdvTool system. Lastly, we show examples of the tools and techniques applied to large (hundreds of thousands of records) multivariate data sets.},

We tackle this problem here with a strategy that computes frequency or density information from the data set, and uses such information in Parallel Coordinates visualizations to filter out the information to be presented to the user, thus reducing visual clutter and allowing the analyst to observe relevant patterns in the data. The algorithms to construct such visualizations, and the interaction mechanisms supported, inspired by traditional image processing techniques such as grayscale manipulation and thresholding are also presented. We also illustrate how such algorithms can assist users to effectively identify clusters in very noisy large data sets.},

Parallel coordinates is an excellent tool for visualizing this type of data but has its limitations.

We solve this problem by constructing clusters and using high precision textures to represent them. We also use transfer functions that operate on the high precision textures in order to highlight different aspects of the cluster characteristics. Providing predefined transfer functions as well as the support to draw customized transfer functions makes it possible to extract different aspects of the data. We also show how feature animation can be used as guidance when simultaneously analysing several clusters.

Parallel coordinate plots and parallel coordinate density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing of data to remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the α-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting.The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the parallel coordinate display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data on the order of 250,000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations. Other illustrations are available on our web page.},

The role of context visualization is to provide an overview of the data for improved user orientation and improved navigation. A good overview comprises the representation of both outliers and trends. Up to now, however, context visualization not really treated outliers sufficiently. In this paper we present a new approach to focus+context visualization in parallel coordinates which is truthful to outliers in the sense that small-scale features are detected before visualization and then treated specially during context visualization. Generally, we present a solution which enables context visualization at several levels of abstraction, both for the representation of outliers and trends. We introduce outlier detection and context generation to parallel coordinates on the basis of a binned data representation. This leads to an output-oriented visualization approach which means that only those parts of the visualization process are executed which actually affect the final rendering. Accordingly, the performance of this solution is much more dependent on the visualization size than on the data size which makes it especially interesting for large datasets. Previous approaches are outperformed, the new solution was successfully applied to datasets with up to 3 million data records and up to 50 dimensions},

	abstract = {This paper introduces two novel techniques to manipulate parallel coordinates. Both techniques are dynamic in nature as they encourage one to experiment and discover new information through interacting with a data set. The first technique, polyline averaging, makes it possible to dynamically summarise a set of polylines and can hence replace computationally much more demanding methods, such as hierarchical clustering. The other new technique interactively visualises correlation coefficients between polyline subsets, helping the user to discover new information in the data set. Both techniques are implemented in a Java-based parallel coordinate browser. In conclusion, examples of the use of these techniques in visual data mining are also explored.},

During recent decades significant research efforts have been devoted to exploring the applicability of the technique and to expand upon it, resulting in a variety of extensions. Of these many research activities, a surprisingly small number concerns user-centred evaluations investigating actual use and usability issues for different tasks, data and domains. The result is a clear lack of convincing evidence to support and guide uptake by users as well as future research directions. To address these issues this paper contributes a thorough literature survey of what has been done in the area of user-centred evaluation of parallel coordinates. These evaluations are divided into four categories based on characterization of use, derived from the survey. Based on the data from the survey and the categorization combined with the authors' experience of working with parallel coordinates, a set of guidelines for future research directions is proposed.},

	abstract = {Analyzing data to find trends, correlations, and stable patterns is an important task in many industrial applications. This paper proposes a new technique based on parallel coordinate visualization. Previous work on parallel coordinate methods has shown that they are effective only when variables that are correlated and/or show similar patterns are displayed adjacently. Although current parallel coordinate tools allow the user to manually rearrange the order of variables, this process is very time-consuming when the number of variables is large. Automated assistance is required. This paper introduces an editdistance based technique to rearrange variables so that interesting change patterns can be easily detected visually. The Visual Miner (V-Miner) software includes both automated methods for visualizing common patterns and a query tool that enables the user to describe specific target patterns to be mined or displayed by the system. In addition, the system can filter data according to rules sets imported from other data mining tools. This feature was found very helpful in practice, because it enables decision makers to visually identify interesting rules and data segments for further analysis or data mining. This paper begins with an introduction to the proposed techniques and the V-Miner system. Next, a case study illustrates how V-Miner has been used at Motorola to guide product design and test decisions.},

Because these mapping functions are usually multidimensional, nonlinear, and discontinuous, finding input parameters that yield desirable output values is often a painful process of manual tweaking. Interactive evolution and inverse design are two general methodologies for computer-assisted parameter setting in which the computer plays a prominent role. In this paper we present another such methodology: Design Gallery TM (DG) interfaces present the user with the broadest selection--- automatically generated and organized--- of perceptually different graphics or animations that can be produced by varying a given input-parameter vector. The principal technical challenges posed by the DG approach are dispersion, finding a set of input-parameter vectors that optimally disperses the resulting output-value vectors, and arrangement, organizing the resulting graphics for easy and intuitive browsing by the user. We describe the use of DGs for several parametersetting problems: light selection and placement for image rendering, both standard and image-based; opacity and color transfer-function specification for volume rendering; and motion control for particle-system and articulated-figure animation.},

In different fields of design, cognitive processes have both similarities and differences. Some of the notable differences that distinguish architectural design from other design fields are rich representations, indiscriminate use of inventive strategies, nonstandard problem composition schema, and strategies of complexity management. In some respects the field of cognitive psychology and even the entire domain of empirical research is about recognizing predictability of measurable events. One way of achieving this is to find the conditional invariants among all of the variables that are of interest. The conditions of such an inquiry are represented by the independent variables. Studies of architectural cognition concern themselves with a few overarching issues: representation, strategic behavior, and innovation. Strategic behavior subsumes issues such as search, problem restructuring, and process management. The last category, innovation, can be seen as a subset of strategic behavior as well.},
